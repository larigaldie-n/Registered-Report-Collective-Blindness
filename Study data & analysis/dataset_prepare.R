# Takes files from /intermediate_data/ET/ (eyeScrollR-corrected files), and
# outputs files in /final_data/, which are complete data files with all
# statements, questionnaire ratings, experimental condition and total dwell
# times
# Then, pick 3 random long (>150ms) fixations at the end of the stimuli
# presentation (after the median of timestamps), pick the central video frame,
# and prepare everything for the outcome-neutral checking that those fixations
# are indeed close to eyeScrollR-corrected fixations. Allows to check if the
# participant did respect instructions regarding only using the mouse wheel
# to scroll, and if eyeScrollR did everything correctly. Those fixations are
# output in ../Fixation check/ET_check
